# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game on a 3x3 grid. One player is "X" and the other is "O." Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell. The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player achieves three in a row or when all cells are filled with no winner, resulting in a draw.
